# Project Lead Meeting #1: Project setup 

Waterfall or Agile?

Due: 17 Oct 

Waterfall does not work:
  - not time efficient, lily works unpredictable hours 
  - little to no communication
  - work load and tasks can not be distributed fairly
  - progress will be slow because each stage must be completed as a collective group before moving on
  - too risky given the circumstances and possible obstacles 
  
Agile is the most practical based on the time and priorities of the members:
  - flexible workload 
  - considerate of each member's time and work ethic 
  - MVP will ensure that the end product will resemble what the group envisioned
  - tasks can be split between members
  - kanban will be more effective at tracking specific goals/tasks; SCRUM
  - lots of input from members and client
  - more creative liberty 
  
  questions:
  
  What features do you dislike about google classroom's management? What would you like to add?
    everything is tgt and its ugly
  Is there a certain way you want the app to look?
  Would you like to have an input table with a history which is seperate from already existing marks? 
  For the class' progress chart, do you want to display the progress of each student?
    The entire progress of each student so far in regards to mastery displayed or a drop down list which displays the specific checks completed?
