# Project Lead Meeting #1: Project setup 

Waterfall or Agile?

Due: 17 Oct 

Waterfall does not work:
  - not time efficient, lily works unpredictable hours 
  - little to no communication
  - work load and tasks can not be distributed fairly
  - progress will be slow because each stage must be completed as a collective group before moving on
  - too risky given the circumstances and possible obstacles 
  
Agile is the most practical based on the time and priorities of the members:
  - flexible workload 
  - considerate of each member's time and work ethic 
  - MVP will ensure that the end product will resemble what the group envisioned
  - tasks can be split between members
  - kanban will be more effective at tracking specific goals/tasks; SCRUM
  - lots of input from members and client
  - more creative liberty 
  
Questions:
- Would you like the app to have multiple pages which each having its own unique function? For example, Page 1 can be a page where you input information, whereas Page 2 can be a page which displays the table containing each student's information and progress.

- Should anyone be able to access the class progress chart/table, or should only the teacher have such permission? Furthermore, would you like to have a way to login/verify information to be able to access the progress chart?

- Exactly what information would you like to be displayed on the progress chart (e.g. first and last name, current grade, current mastery check, time that the information was last updated)? You mentioned that would like an app that tracks your students' progress on mastery checks while also keeping grades and mastery checks separate. Does that mean you would like two charts, one displaying mastery check progress while another displays grades, a chart displaying both but separated from each other, or just a chart with only mastery checks, no grades at all?

- How would you like progress to be displayed? Would you prefer just one column in the progress chart displaying the last completed mastery check, or would you prefer something like a checklist which displays all mastery checks available?

- Would you like every student's progress be displayed at once, or would you prefer something like a drop-down list which can display specifically one student's progress? How would you like the drop-down list to be filtered (e.g. by name, by last completed mastery check, etc.)?

- Would you like dedicated buttons on the progress chart to be able to edit/update information or delete a whole row?
